# Personal website
This is the personal website I made to show some of my interests and projects.
Take a look at - https://soupsoup00.github.io/

## License
I chose the MIT license because I used plenty of other sources to help me develop different features of my website, and am open to others using the same code for a similar result. I don't feel the need to restrict the usage of my code, as this was a personal project that mainly served as a learning experience.
